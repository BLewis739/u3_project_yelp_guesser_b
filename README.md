## Concept

The gameplay of the app is inspired by the popular game [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), where players are shown an image from Google Street View of a random world location, and try to guess where it is. In our version, players are presented images of restaurant meals from the Yelp API. Based on the appearance of the food in the image, players guess the Yelp star rating of its restaurant. After viewing 5 images and making 5 guesses, a player's score is calculated.
